All the sciences are inter-related. Although biology uses physics, chemistry and other physical sciences in explaining its phenomena, biological principles are not merely an application of physicochemical laws. The laws of many life processes have no counterparts in physics or chemistry.

Many biological concepts can be expressed mathematically but others cannot. Biological sciences at present are often restricted to mere descriptive statements of general phenomena without quantitative connotation.

Biological systems are represented by many levels of organisation, not all of which have been resolved into concise concepts and testable theories. Many branches of study serve to connect biology to other sciences, such as paleontology, biophysics and biochemistry. There has been a marked trend for some time towards a synthesis of the biological sciences with other sciences.
