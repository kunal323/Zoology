Zoology is such a vast subject that advanced workers in the field tend to specialise in one or more of the subdivisions in which they can hope to become very proficient. The subdivisions are grouped according to two types of approach.

I. Subdivisions According to Subject Matter:

a. Morphology (Gr., morphe = form; logos â€“ study):

The study of the physical structure of organisms.

(i) External morphology:

The study of external features of animals.

(ii) Anatomy (Gr., ana = up; tome = cutting):

The study of gross structure of the internal organs by dissection, that which can be seen with the naked eyes.
